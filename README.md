# Overview

In this workshop, we will bridge the gap between advanced microscopy data generation and the computational skills required for its analysis. By leveraging open-source tools like Python and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), participants will learn to automate image analysis, enhancing the precision, efficiency, and reproducibility of their research. This event, led by experienced core facility staff from the Francis Crick Institute, offers a practical approach to mastering quantitative analysis and workflow automation, essential for advancing research across multiple domains.

# Registration

>Registration for this workshop is currently open [on Workday](https://wd3.myworkday.com/crick/learning/course/63ce9e2ca2e110014261acef84a90000?type=9882927d138b100019b6a2df1a46018b)

# FAQ

1. **Do I need any prior knowledge of image analysis to attend?**

    No, but a basic understanding of image acquisition would be beneficial.

2. **Do I need to have any experience of coding?**

    We will start from the basics, but move quite swiftly to coding exercises â€“ therefore, some basic experience in coding in any programming languages (including Fiji macro language) will be beneficial to make the most of this course.
